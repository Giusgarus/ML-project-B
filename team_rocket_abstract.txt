In this work, we used a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), minibatch training, L2 regularization, Nesterov momentum, and early stopping with tolerance based on the validation Mean Squared Error (MSE). A greedy search with exhaustive k-fold cross-validation was performed over a large parameter space, followed by nested k-fold cross-validation for risk estimation. The training dataset was split into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing.
